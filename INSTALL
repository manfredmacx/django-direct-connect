Thanks for downloading Django-direct-connect

To install, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer, you can simply place the included ``direct_connect`` directory
somewhere on your PYTHONPATH, or symlink to it from somewhere on your
PYTHONPATH; this is useful if you're working from a Git checkout.

Inside your Django settings.py, you will need to add the following:

DC_USERNAME:  The username for your account provided by Direct Connect
DC_PASSWORD:  The password for this account
DC_URL:  The payment url provided by Direct Connect
AESKEY:  A secret key of 16 upper and lower case letters and numbers used by the encryption algorithm

Make sure to also add 'direct_connect' to your list of installed apps and run syncdb.

Note that this application was developed using Django 1.1 and Python 2.6.  It may work with other versions, but has not been tested.
You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
